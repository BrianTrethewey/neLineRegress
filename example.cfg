#This section sets a desired line if any for the graph to be used for comparisons
# auto is a boolean flag, if true  expected slope or lambda fields are ignored and a  line is produced with a slope that is the average of all other lines supplied
# expected slope is read as a float and is used to produce a line with the expected slope overrides any lambda fields
# lambda is converted to a slope using the formula lambda -1 and this is used as the expected slop field
# to produce a graph with no epected line omit this entire section.

#this section sets the limits of axis of the graph, by default the graph will be fit to the data, for these to be used both a min and a max value need to be included or defaults will be used

# xMax is the maximum value of x shown
# yMin is the minimum value of y shown,
# yMax is the maximum value of y shown

#alpha: this float value sets the alpha value to be used for confidence intervals this should be a value less than 0.5

#outputFilename: String to indicate where the output file for the statistical data should be saved. default == statsOut.txt
